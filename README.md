# Python
Python code demonstrating machine learning, use of the Pandas library, data cleaning, and multiprocessing.



#Lichess Multiprocessing is the program which generates the datasets which are used in Pandas Queries and the Machine Learning on Chess programs.
#The output of the program is included as the "Lichess 2013-01_int_array" and "Lichess 2013-01_str_list" files.
#These two files are necessary for running the Pandas Queries and the Machine Learning on Chess programs. 
#Some comments are made in the programs about their output, and the reader is encouraged to examine them for context.


#The file which LiChess Multiprocessing examines can be found by going to: https://database.lichess.org/ and downloading 
#the 2013-January games file in .pgn notation. After doing so, replace the file path to access the file and run the program.
