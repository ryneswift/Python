Python code and outputs demonstrating machine learning, use of the Pandas library, data cleaning, and multiprocessing.

The 'Code Files' folder contains .py files, while the "Output Files" folder contains outputs corresponding to each .py.

The file necessary to be input into the Lichess Multiprocessing program can be downloaded via the instructions at the bottom of this readme, while its output is included as the "Lichess 2013-01_int_array" and "Lichess 2013-01_str_list" files. These two files are necessary for running the 'Pandas Queries' and the 'Lichess Machine Learning' programs. Furthermore, 'svm_model_summary_array.csv' is needed to run the 'Lichess Machine Learning' program.

The file which LiChess Multiprocessing examines can be found by going to: https://database.lichess.org/ and downloading the 2013-January games file in .pgn notation.
