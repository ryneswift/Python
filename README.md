Python code and output demonstrating machine learning, use of the Pandas library, data cleaning, and multiprocessing.

Lichess Machine Learning Sample Output is the output of the file Machine Learning on Chess.

Lichess Multiprocessing is the program which generates the datasets which are used in Pandas Queries and the Machine Learning on Chess programs. 

The file necessary to be input into the Lichess Multiprocessing program can be downloaded via the instructions at the bottom of this readme, while its output is included as the "Lichess 2013-01_int_array" and "Lichess 2013-01_str_list" files. These two files are necessary for running the Pandas Queries and the Machine Learning on Chess programs. 

The file which LiChess Multiprocessing examines can be found by going to: https://database.lichess.org/ and downloading the 2013-January games file in .pgn notation. After doing so, replace the file path to access the file and run the program.
